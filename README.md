# obs_twitter_post_script
Sends pre-written X post when stream is active with streamer's active stream details

The config_file.py needs some editing before running.

simply place the main script in the obs folder: ...obs-studio\data\obs-plugins\frontend-tools\scripts

Within the OBS, select the Tools > Scripts and then add the relevent script.

if they script does not run please refer to my answer on stackoverflow:
